The purpose of this application is to bring all the functionalities of the translator to a native application that should run faster than in a browser and adapted to the screen.

Among other advantages, a native application will benefit from many android libraries and could bring new functionalities and experiences.

The library “Volley” will be used to connect with Json to the translator.

I'm not discarding to make the application work offline in the future.
